# My shop is realized in two projects: server and client. This is a client project. They communicate by Http protocol.

1. Firstly we need to register as client or as seller.

13. Also we can change our password. If password and confirm password dose'nt match it will be an exception.
With old password we have the same situation as in updating profile.
